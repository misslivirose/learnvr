As much as I'll try to cover these as I go, I might miss a few! If you're not familiar with virtual reality (VR) or augmented reality (AR) then you can reference this page if something comes up that I forget to define!

_VR_- Short for 'virtual reality'. Generally used to describe 3D applications that are viewed inside of a headset to transport the viewer to a virtual world. Examples of VR devices include the Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, Samsung Gear VR, Google Daydream, and FOVE.

_AR_ - Short for 'augmented reality'. Used to describe applications or hardware that add digital visual elements to the world around us. Examples of AR devices include Meta Glass, Google Glass, and Google Tango phones.

_MR_ - Used for either 'mixed' or 'merged' reality to describe applications, technologies, or hardware that combine various elements of virtual and augmented reality technologies. Examples of MR devices include Microsoft's HoloLens and Intel's Project Alloy.

_XR_ - An umbrella term that can be used to cover VR, AR, and MR 

_HMD / Headset_ - 'Head mounted display'. A device worn on the head for AR, MR, or VR, generally with lenses and a display to show digital content to the user. These devices may be tethered to a PC, completely standalone, or mobile-phone based.

_360 Content_ - an image, video, or CG (computer generated) experience that surrounds the entire area around a viewer. Often used as "360 degree video/photo" to differentiate between an interactive experience. An example of computer-generated 360 degree video content is Oculus Story Studio's Henry.

_Interactive Experience_ - an application that allows the user to control various elements of the program. An example of interactive VR content is Google's Tiltbrush.

_Game Engine_ - a software program designated 'middleware' to assist with the creation of 3D experiences. Examples of game engines include Unreal Engine and Unity.

_WebXR / WebVR / VR Web_ - The API and frameworks in place to bring virtual and augmented reality support into the browser. The WebVR API is a collaboration and standard supported by Mozilla, Google, Microsoft, Samsung, and Facebook / Oculus.

_Social VR_ - experiences that are built for simultaneous use by multiple people, sharing a digital space. 

_Desktop VR_ - a headset powered by a desktop computer. Generally has higher performance and more extensive tracking capabilities than a mobile VR headset, with a trade-off in price and portability. Examples include the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive. 

_Mobile VR_ - a headset that is powered by a mobile smartphone. Generally lower in cost, more portable, and less feature-complete than desktop VR headsets. Examples include Daydream and Gear VR.

_OpenXR_ - the Khronos initiative for a common virtual and augmented reality standard for immersive devices and software applications

_OSVR_ - Open Source Virtual Reality

_3D Modeling_ - the process of using software to create a model that can be used as an asset in a 3D application. Common 3D modeling tools include Blender, Maya, and 3DS Max. Popular VR applications for 3D modeling are Tiltbrush and Medium.

_Rift_ - an Oculus Rift, which is a type of headset made by Oculus (Facebook)

_Vive_ - an HTC Vive, which is a type of headset primarily known for its full room-scale tracking ability

_Hand Controllers_ - referring to specialized controllers that you can use to track your hands within a space to more naturally interact with the virtual world around you

_Simulation_ - a virtual representation of an environment

_Unity_ - a 3D game engine

_High Fidelity / "HiFi"_ - an open source social VR world building platform 

_Google Cardboard_ - first iteration of Google's mobile VR based headsets, literally made of cardboard that you popped your phone into

_Gaze Tracking_ - Following where the viewer is looking with their head, usually extrapolated from the center of the view

_Stereoscopic_ - a scene visually separated into two different viewpoints offset to be rendered more similarly to how our eyes perceive the world

_HoloLens_ - Microsoft's Mixed Reality (AR) headset

_Avatar_ - a virtual person that represents a real person

_WebGL_ - an API for graphics rendering in the browser

_Rendering_ - the process of drawing virtual content to your display

_a-dash_ - the designation within opening and closing <> tags for A-Frame, a markup style language from Mozilla for creating 3D scenes for WebVR

_locomotion_ - how a user moves within a VR scene. Examples could include using a joystick, flying, or teleportation

_spatial user interface_ - a type of user interface that a player interacts with in a three-dimensional virtual world

_blockchain_ - a distributed computing solution where data is written to a ledger, which is copied across nodes to verify integrity of the data

_EMCA Script_ - the standardized base language for JavaScript

_Qt_ - a C++ framework 

_Distributed architecture_ - one where components of a system are run across multiple machines, often in many different locations

_Cloud Services_ - services that are provided by a company and run on a virtual host, rather than running on a local server or application

_JimJamz Show_ - a live show produced by High Fidelity where 3D artists streamed from within VR to YouTube and Twitch

_Nightbot API_ - a service that allows you to support multiple streaming services and create custom behaviors and commands
