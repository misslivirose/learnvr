As much as I'll try to cover these as I go, I might miss a few! If you're not familiar with virtual reality (VR) or augmented reality (AR) then you can reference this page if something comes up that I forget to define!

_VR_- Short for 'virtual reality'. Generally used to describe 3D applications that are viewed inside of a headset to transport the viewer to a virtual world. Examples of VR devices include the Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, Samsung Gear VR, Google Daydream, and FOVE.

_AR_ - Short for 'augmented reality'. Used to describe applications or hardware that add digital visual elements to the world around us. Examples of AR devices include Meta Glass, Google Glass, and Google Tango phones.

_MR_ - Used for either 'mixed' or 'merged' reality to describe applications, technologies, or hardware that combine various elements of virtual and augmented reality technologies. Examples of MR devices include Microsoft's HoloLens and Intel's Project Alloy.

_XR_ - An umbrella term that can be used to cover VR, AR, and MR 

_HMD / Headset_ - 'Head mounted display'. A device worn on the head for AR, MR, or VR, generally with lenses and a display to show digital content to the user. These devices may be tethered to a PC, completely standalone, or mobile-phone based.

_360 Content_ - an image, video, or CG (computer generated) experience that surrounds the entire area around a viewer. Often used as "360 degree video/photo" to differentiate between an interactive experience. An example of computer-generated 360 degree video content is Oculus Story Studio's Henry.

_Interactive Experience_ - an application that allows the user to control various elements of the program. An example of interactive VR content is Google's Tiltbrush.

_Game Engine_ - a software program designated 'middleware' to assist with the creation of 3D experiences. Examples of game engines include Unreal Engine and Unity.

_WebXR / WebVR / VR Web_ - The API and frameworks in place to bring virtual and augmented reality support into the browser. The WebVR API is a collaboration and standard supported by Mozilla, Google, Microsoft, Samsung, and Facebook / Oculus.

_Social VR_ - experiences that are built for simultaneous use by multiple people, sharing a digital space. 

_Desktop VR_ - a headset powered by a desktop computer. Generally has higher performance and more extensive tracking capabilities than a mobile VR headset, with a trade-off in price and portability. Examples include the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive. 

_Mobile VR_ - a headset that is powered by a mobile smartphone. Generally lower in cost, more portable, and less feature-complete than desktop VR headsets. Examples include Daydream and Gear VR.

_OpenXR_ - the Khronos initiative for a common virtual and augmented reality standard for immersive devices and software applications

_OSVR_ - Open Source Virtual Reality

_3D Modeling_ - the process of using software to create a model that can be used as an asset in a 3D application. Common 3D modeling tools include Blender, Maya, and 3DS Max. Popular VR applications for 3D modeling are Tiltbrush and Medium.

_Rift_ - an Oculus Rift, which is a type of headset made by Oculus (Facebook)

_Vive_ - an HTC Vive, which is a type of headset primarily known for its full room-scale tracking ability

_Hand Controllers_ - referring to specialized controllers that you can use to track your hands within a space to more naturally interact with the virtual world around you
